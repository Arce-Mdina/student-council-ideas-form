                    The student-led assemblies are assemblies that are led 
                    by the students where students can share their ideas, 
                    showcase leadership, and help shape conversations that 
                    builds a better school community.

                    Litter on the Astro pitch is a concern that many students have raised 
                    over the years. In order to address this problem, we spoke with the staff 
                    in charge and decided that a feasible solution to address the litter on 
                    the Astro pitch was to ensure easy access to bins at both exits and 
                    entrances to the field.

                    Henceforth, there are now bins at both of the entrances to the field; 
                    furthermore, there is a member of staff in charge of cleaning the Astro 
                    pitch weekly.  However, it is important that everyone does their part and 
                    throws their rubbish away, and possibly any litter they see.
